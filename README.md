## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README
> Designed with precision. Built for timeless elegance. 🕰️✨ 

## 🏛️ The Ethos of the Design  

The act of telling time is, at its core, an interface between human intuition and mechanical precision. In conceiving this clock, the ambition was not merely to represent the passing of time but to elevate it— rendering it **legible, balanced, and profoundly elegant**.  

Inspired by **Dieter Rams’ timeless philosophy**, this clock is a study in **visual harmony**. Each element—its proportions, its placement, its movement—has been deliberately composed to serve a singular purpose: to express time with **clarity and poise**.  

## 🔍 The Challenge of Refinement  

The journey of design is often defined not by what is added, but by what is removed. The clock began as a simple concept, yet it soon became clear that subtle complexities would define its refinement.  

### **1. The Central Problem: WebGL’s Shifted Origin**  
A fundamental design challenge emerged when transitioning to **WebGL**. The coordinate system shifted, **relocating the origin to the center**, rendering previous placements obsolete. What followed was not merely a technical recalibration but an opportunity to reassess the **spatial relationships** between elements. By **rethinking the proportions dynamically**, the design evolved into something even more deliberate—where symmetry was no longer an afterthought but an intrinsic feature of its elegance.  

### **2. The Pursuit of Perfect Balance**  
The **minute dots** presented an unexpected conundrum. Originally functional but visually disconnected, they needed to **harmonise with the clock face and second bars**. The breakthrough came through **proportional spacing**, adjusting their arrangement to **mirror the cadence of time itself**—each dot aligned with intention, reinforcing the aesthetic rhythm of the piece.  

### **3. The Subtlety of the AM/PM Indicator**  
A timepiece should not demand attention; it should offer information effortlessly. The **AM/PM indicator** was approached with this sensibility—its presence should be **intuitive, yet unobtrusive**. The solution? A **single dot** that shifts in hue:  

- **A warm, burnt orange (`#E15E3E`) for AM**—invoking the morning sun.  
- **A deep, contemplative blue (`#315B7B`) for PM**—mirroring the quiet descent into evening.  

Accompanied by the subtle typography of "AM" and "PM", this element exists as a **whisper rather than a declaration**, reinforcing a sense of calm precision.  

### **4. Milliseconds: The Final Layer of Polish**  
The inclusion of **milliseconds** posed a final challenge: how to integrate them **without disrupting elegance**. The solution was not another indicator, but a more **visceral experience**—a soft **glow above the minute dots**, gently expanding and contracting with each passing moment. This decision transformed milliseconds from an abstract numerical value into something *felt* rather than merely *seen*.  

## 🌎 A Timeless Expression of Time  

What was achieved is not just a functional clock, but a reflection of **our relationship with time itself**. It is a **study in precision, balance, and clarity**—not merely a mechanism for measuring hours and minutes, but an artifact that embodies **graceful movement and quiet sophistication**. It is a meditation on our analog way of life, the passing minutes between birth and death and why we choose to observe breath.

This clock is not defined by what it does, but by **how effortlessly it does it**.  
It does not demand attention, but rewards those who notice.

## ✨ Design Refinements & Intentional Choices  

### 1. **WebGL Origin Adjustment**  
- Ensured all elements remain proportionally positioned by **recalibrating the coordinate system** for WebGL's centered origin. This was later abandoned to maintain the focus on elgenace in my design and stick to the basics of the task.

### 2. **AM/PM Indicator Integration**  
- A **minimalistic dot** now denotes AM/PM with elegant color changes:  
  - **AM** → `#E15E3E` *(warm sunrise tone)*  
  - **PM** → `#315B7B` *(cool dusk blue)*  
- Subtle yet effective placement to **maintain symmetry** within the clock’s structure.  

### 3. **Refined Typography for Time Period**  
- **"AM" / "PM" labels** added near the indicator using a **discreet, modern typeface**, ensuring **clarity without visual clutter**.  

### 4. **Repositioned Minute Dots**  
- The **minute dots grid** was brought **closer to the center**, aligning with the second bars to **achieve visual balance**.  

### 5. **Unified Element Sizing**  
- **Minute dots resized** to match the AM/PM indicator's scale, ensuring **consistent visual weight** and **cohesion**.  

### 6. **Millisecond Glow Effect**  
- A **soft, expanding glow** above the minute dots subtly represents **milliseconds**, adding a final layer of polish while maintaining **elegance**.  

### 7. **Refined Second Bars Animation**  
- Animation logic was improved for **smoother transitions**, enhancing the **fluidity of motion** without abrupt shifts.  

### 8. **Clock Hand Proportions & Placement**  
- The **hour, minute, and second hands** were adjusted in **length and stroke weight** for **better contrast and visual hierarchy**.  

### 9. **Harmonized Color Palette**  
- A **timeless palette** of deep neutrals with selective warm/cool tones enhances **legibility and aesthetic consistency**.  

### 10. **Maintained Dieter Rams' Philosophy**  
> _"Good design is as little design as possible."_  
- Every refinement adheres to **simplicity, clarity, and function**, ensuring a **sophisticated yet practical** user experience. 

## 🎓Major Sucesses
- Overall harmony and balance of proportions, color, spacing and symmetry
- Catching up 2 weeks worth of 2nd year coding and completing the assignment on the due date (I really did graft for this)
- Communication of Braun infused design ethos -> employing analog practices into the digital space
- Reducing clutter and gaining clairty through elegance 
- The beauty of simply observing the time passing

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
- Implementing **smooth easing transitions** for hands  
- Exploring **adaptive color shifts** based on real-time ambient conditions

## DAY ONE REALLY GETTING STRAPPED and MAEDA CLOCK:
 Just opened the Project and really started trying to figure out what the hell is going on in the code base and generally -> life philosphy is just to keep moving forward putting one foot over the other and not looking back 

Maeda clock was a lot of fun to start getting back into the zone for coding: been trying to find my feet and flow through all the tooling again and I found this exercise was the most helpful in converying the mechanics in my head in a more elegant way. 

The Maeda Clock took inspiration from clock 2 and clock 9. I tried to figure out how to do a more gradual effect for adding a yellow dot every second and having it build up but it started getting very complicated with the framecount and going back to first year animation code and it was just getting messy so its a little jarring but the overall concept is communicated more simply in the code this way. 

Esseantially there is a circle displaying the hour, minute and second with a rotating hand around the clock like in clock 9 and the background dots correspond to the build up in seconds as more and more are generated (supposed to be in realtion to the seconds)

## Major Update on the Clock (writing this on the Clock)
There was a repivot in the change in concept after reflecting on my meeting with Phoebe. Deciding against going for a grunged out, in your face kind of aesthetic and instead going back to the direction of simplicity and great design as a communicator of function. Returning to a way of obsessing towards a more analog way of using digital technology is my underlying mantra so I got my head back in check and did some rethinking of my clock's affect and decided that pulling form my core design inspiration strings was far more condusive to a great outcome 

Used the following color palette as inspiration (will be working on adding an image in here to show them visually - a visual moodboard if you will)

## THE NEW FINAL LOOK AND FEEL AIM

✅ Minimal, structured, and modular
✅ Upward-flowing bars for a modern touch
✅ Dieter Rams’ principle of ‘less but better’
✅ A soft, visually appealing contrast

## 🔹 Clock Hands:
	•	Made thinner and precise, with a Braun-style red second hand
	•	Centered alignment for a timeless aesthetic

## 🔹 Seconds Bars:
	•	Flow upwards instead of down
	•	Added lerp() for a smooth brightness fade-in effect

## 🔹 Minimal Typography:
	•	Subtle hour markers (12, 3, 6, 9) in gray
	•	Aligned properly using a modular grid

## 🔹 Color & Contrast Adjustments:
	•	Dark gray (30,30,30) instead of harsh black
	•	Soft white glow instead of pure white for a premium feel
	•	Background set to 245 (light gray) for a refined Apple/Braun-inspired look

I have the clock now in a state that i think looks well designed and in line with my aestehtic choices. I am currently troubleshooting how I get the red seconds clock to tick in a clockwise direction and will be working on adding a simple and elegant alarm function as well as a simple system for changing the color scheme to reflect the time of day. 

Modifications for drawSecondBars
	•	Uses lerpColor between a dim gray and a bright white.
	•	Creates a subtle glowing effect for active bars.
	•	Enhances the aesthetics without overcomplicating the design.

Modifications for drawMinuteDots 
	•	Better Readability & Clarity – Using a distinct color (#AAB7BF) instead of brightness changes ensures each filled minute is clearly visible, even in different lighting conditions.
	•	Consistent & Elegant Aesthetic – A muted blue-gray aligns with the minimalist, Braun/Dieter Rams-inspired design, making the display feel more intentional and refined.
	•	Improved User Intuition – A dedicated color for elapsed minutes makes it easier to read time at a glance, avoiding any ambiguity caused by varying shades of gray.

## Updates 
I talked with Phoebe about the alarm system and a viusal way of represtenig that and after playing around with the idea of having 0 and 1's appear across screen taking reference from Patrick Lynch's Windows 95 solution to the alarm system I still felt it was more effective to display the alarm simply and elegantly with an evenly distrubuted alarm system that is evokes refernce to the same source material mentioned above with a focus again on color selection still. It also compliments the overall aesthetic choices of the design and keeps the purpose and intent of aesthetic focus paramount and preferential. 

## How to get the Analog Clock Design to display
In order to see the mechanics of the analog clock a number of steps need to be taken on:
- First you need to go into the runner.js file and add WEBGL as a third paramter when creating the canvas in the main setup function. 
- Second you will need to uncomment textFont(myFont) in the same main setup function 
- Third you will need to copy across all the code in flipClock.js and paste it over the clock.js code 
- Finally port and run the code and the clock function can now display the analog flip clock attempt
