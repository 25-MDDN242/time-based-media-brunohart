# DAY ONE REALLY GETTING STRAPPED:
 Just opened the Project and really started trying to figure out what the hell is going on in the code base and generally -> life philosphy is just to keep moving forward putting one foot over the other and not looking back 

Maeda clock was a lot of fun to start getting back into the zone for coding: been trying to find my feet and flow through all the tooling again and I found this exercise was the most helpful in converying the mechanics in my head in a more elegant way. 

The Maeda Clock took inspiration from clock 2 and clock 9. I tried to figure out how to do a more gradual effect for adding a yellow dot every second and having it build up but it started getting very complicated with the framecount and going back to first year animation code and it was just getting messy so its a little jarring but the overall concept is communicated more simply in the code this way. 

Esseantially there is a circle displaying the hour, minute and second with a rotating hand around the clock like in clock 9 and the background dots correspond to the build up in seconds as more and more are generated (supposed to be in realtion to the seconds)
